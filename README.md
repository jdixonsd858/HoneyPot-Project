# HoneyPot (T-Pot) Project

## Objective

The primary objective of this project is to create a HoneyPot and gain practical, system administration and network security practices using a virtual environment. This is achieved by installing and configuring a VM Web Server on a DigitalOcean Virtual Machine (VM), followed by establishing secure remote access using PowerShell and SSH. Key technical tasks include managing the systemâ€”specifically adding a new user and ensuring the VM is updated and upgraded with elevated privileges. Crucially, this project emphasizes troubleshooting by requiring the resolution of potential SSH connection and 'no connection' issues. The culminating security goal involves the installation and configuration of a sophisticated honeypot system (T-Pot), followed by actively monitoring and analyzing observed attacks and security alerts.

### Skills Learned 

- Install and configure VM Web Server using DigitalOcean.
- How to SSH into my VM using Powershell.
- Using Powershell, add a user and update / upgrade with sudo.
- Troubleshoot SSH connection issues and 'no connection' issues.
- Install a honeyPot (T-Pot) via Powershell.
- View attacks and alerts.
- Development of critical thinking and trouble-shooting skills in cybersecurity.

### Tools Used

- Digital Ocean as a cloud service provider and PaaS.
- Digital Ocean to create a VM (Web Server).
- Powershell to SSH into VM Web Server.
- Powershell to create new user, and install T-Pot (Honeypot)
- T-Pot to view different types of attacks.
